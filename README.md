# mcb-protein_isolation
protein isolation lab needs a few spectra graphs of protein isolated from spinach leaves to confirm presence of protein RuBisco.

## Project Tasks:
* create csv from raw spectra data
* graph spectra for ammonium sulfate precipitation fractions with the highest protein content confirmed by highest absorbance at 280 nm spectrophotometric wavelength.

## Hypothesis statement
* specific and concise hypothesis statement 

## Results
* Table 1 - Spectrum Analysis
    * Table 1 showing all the wavelengths and corresponding OD values with table description.
* Figure 1 
    *  Properly labelled spectrum analysis graphs of 11 samples with detailed description of what the graph is telling you. 
* Figure 2 - Western Blot Membrane and description
    * Properly labelled membrane with detailed figure description mentioning not only what the lanes have but also what the membrane is giving us information about.
* Table 2 
    * Table 2 showing the kDa, log kDa and the distance for corresponding bands with description so as to what is this table showing and what will it be used for.
* Figure 3: Standard curve and description
    * To the scale standard curve properly labelled with correct x and y-axes and units. Standard curve equation. In detail description.
* Table 3 
    * Tabulate the distance migrated and molecular size calculated for all the unknown (sample) bands that you observe on the membrane.

## Calculations 
* Preform calculations for at least 2 bands obtained from gel electrophoresis - western blotting and show others in table or detail format.

## Result Conclusions
* One to two sentences mentioning final results after conducting the 4 sets of protein isolation techniques.

## Discussions 
* Detailed description of the techniques used and for what they were used.
* How did you reach to your results? 
*  Proper link between results obtained and data analyzed. 
* Mentioned ideal results and troubleshooting if ideal results were  not achieved.
